# giftwrapr üéÅ

The `giftwrapr` package helps you wrap your R projects in a Docker container based on [rocker/tidyverse](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/tidyverse/) for distribution of extra-special easy-to-reproduce code (with a bow). It detects the packages used in your project and ensures that they are part of the Dockerfile for automatic installation. It detects your current version of these packages and R (at runtime) facilitating easy replication of your environment.

## Installation

To install `giftwrapr`, you can use the following commands:

``` r
# Install the package from your local repository
devtools::install_github("jflournoy/giftwrapr")
```

## Usage

### Example Workflow

1.  **Set up your project directory**: Ensure your R project is set up with all necessary scripts and data if applicable.

2.  **Generate Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml**: Run the following commands to generate the necessary Docker configuration files.

``` r
library(giftwrapr)

# Set up the Docker environment
setup_docker_environment(project_dir = "/path/to/your/project")
```

3. **Check** your Dockerfile! Especially check that it's installing packages from the correct location. If you need to install packages from github, make sure to change the appropriate `remotes::install_version` lines. For this project, for example, I deleted autogenerated line in the Dockerfile that attempts to install this package, which is not on CRAN.

4.  **Build and run the Docker container**: Navigate to your project directory and use Docker Compose to build and run the Docker container.

``` bash
cd /path/to/your/project
docker-compose up --build
```

5.  **Access RStudio**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8787`. You should see the RStudio server running with your project files and the specified package environment.

### Generating a Dockerfile

The `generate_dockerfile` function generates a Dockerfile for your project. It detects the R packages used in your project and includes them in the Dockerfile, ensuring the specified versions are installed.

``` r
library(giftwrapr)

# Generate Dockerfile for the project in the current directory
generate_dockerfile()
```

#### Parameters:

-   `project_dir`: The path to the project directory (default is the current working directory).
-   `additional_cmds`: Additional Dockerfile commands to be added (optional).
-   `use_latest_versions`: Logical indicating whether to use the latest versions of packages.
-   `r_version`: The R version to be used in the Docker image (default is the current R version).
-   `platform`: The platform to be used (default is "linux/amd64").

### Generating docker-compose.yml

The `generate_docker_compose` function generates a `docker-compose.yml` file for your project. It builds the Docker image from the Dockerfile and sets up the necessary configuration to run an RStudio server.

``` r
library(giftwrapr)

# Generate docker-compose.yml for the project in the current directory
generate_docker_compose()
```

#### Parameters:

-   `project_dir`: The path to the project directory (default is the current working directory).
-   `service_name`: The name of the service (default is "app").
-   `image_name`: The name of the Docker image (default is the project directory name).

### Both at Once

The `setup_docker_environment` function combines the functionality of `generate_dockerfile` and `generate_docker_compose`. It generates both the Dockerfile and the `docker-compose.yml` file for your project.

``` r
library(giftwrapr)

# Setup Docker environment for the project in the current directory
setup_docker_environment()
```

#### Parameters:

-   `project_dir`: The path to the project directory (default is the current working directory).
-   `use_latest_versions`: Logical indicating whether to use the latest versions of packages.
-   `r_version`: The R version to be used in the Docker image (default is the current R version).
-   `platform`: The platform to be used (default is "linux/amd64").
-   `service_name`: The name of the service (default is the project directory name).
